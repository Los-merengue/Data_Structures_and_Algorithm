"""
Print vs. Return in Functions
Here are two valid functions. One returns a value and one simply 
prints a value, without returning anything. Test run this code 
and experiment to understand the difference.

# this prints something, but does not return anything
def show_plus_ten(num):
    print(num + 10)


# this returns something
def add_ten(num):
    return(num + 10)
